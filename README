Autoencoder

A first attempt at implementing an Autoencoder, both using the Numpy and Tensorflow packages.

encode.py -> A pure Numpy implementation, see for an in depth look at things like the backpropoagation and feed forward algorithms
encode_tf.py -> an implementation in Tensorflow, see for a basic example of the Tensorflow library
